# django_rest_api_demo

Tutorial Followed: https://medium.com/swlh/build-your-first-rest-api-with-django-rest-framework-e394e39a482c

## Base Goal
The goal of this repo is to create a basic demo hello world version of a Django Rest API

## Description:
This API holds a list of Super Heros and their Aliases. You are able to navigate to `/heros` to see a full list of heros or you can navigate to `/heros/id` where `id` is replaced with the integer primary key of the desired hero. The API allows for basic CRUD operations. Heros can be created, read, updated, and deleted all using the API. More progress detailing a tutortial on how to set this up and build it will be posted in the future.
